Mathos-Project-Tutorial
=======================

This is a tutorial that describes the way Mathos Project open source products can be used to perform mathematical calculations.

AIM
----
The aim of this book is to cover each module in Mathos Core Library (http://mathos.codeplex.com/) and Mathos Parser.
C# is the target environment, although it might be changed to Iron Ruby instead, to allow Mahtos Core Library Interpreter to be used (http://mathosproject.com/product/mcli/)
