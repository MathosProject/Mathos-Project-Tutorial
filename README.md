Mathos Project Tutorial
=======================

This is a tutorial that describes the way Mathos Project open source products can be used to perform mathematical calculations.

AIM
----
The aim of this book is to cover each module in Mathos Core Library (http://mathos.codeplex.com/) and Mathos Parser.
C# is the target environment, although it might be changed to Iron Ruby instead, to allow Mahtos Core Library Interpreter to be used (http://mathosproject.com/product/mcli/)


TOOLS
-----
In order to contribute, you can use TeXstudio together with MiKTeX
* Download TeXstudio: http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/
* Download MiKTeX: http://miktex.org/

IN CASE it does not work out, or if you don't want to install these programs, a portable version can be used: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6416038/texstudio%2BMKPortable.zip
